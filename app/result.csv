Fair play to the editors of Honest Trailers. Especially ones where they do a gag like the head shot one. That‚Äôs a lot of work.,admiration,positive
Imagine if John Wick just left the gas station a little earlier.,neutral,neutral
They forgot the 'Pencil Us In', the 'Stabbing Headache', the 'Eye Must Scream' and the 'Quick Reload/Double Kill' Headshots. Also throwing things at people (Helmets, Guns, Unbalanced Knives).,neutral,negative
"john wick is immune to cars running him over" killed me,sadness,negative
You'd think at one point in the sequels, one assassin would put their gun down and just walk away.,neutral,negative
"My money's on Tom.. little guy freaks me out..." I died at that line, it made me laugh so hard,amusement,positive
I loved the cameo from the The Raid martial artists and the fact he didn‚Äôt kill them. It was a nice little Easter egg that seemed like a mark of respect.,love,positive
Those John Wick movies and the Atomic Blonde movie are just epic because  there are so very few cuts in the action scenes.  Also love Scott Adkins output. That man is such an underrated action star.,admiration,positive
6:03 the way he made his voice sound like he was underwater for the ‚ÄúUnderwater headshot‚Äù was so cool,admiration,positive

Lionsgate is filming 4 and 5 while writing and planning a 6th and 7th. Good thing Keanu is immortal.,admiration,positive
it may go on and make the story more ridiculous, but those well choreographed fight scenes without too much cuts and without shaky cam will always be intense and entertaining to me,amusement,positive
The 'Who needs a gun headshot' was a perfect finisher. 

The muffled voice underwater headshot was epic. 

Well done.
 Lol,admiration,positive
I love how this video pointed out so many flaws of these moves but still managed to make these movies look awesome af,love,positive
I just adore how Screen Junkies and our dear Epic Voice Guy can make a movie sound so terrible and yet so awesome at the same time.,admiration,positive
Exactly. Everyone in the world is part of the underworld because it's Keanu's own Matrix that they made specially for him,approval,neutral

You guys are awesome this was hands down the best honest trailer ever!!!!!! Those headshot names had me literally rolling. Please never stop!!!!!,admiration,positive

I wish Keanu would upload his reaction to this Honest Trailer. Somebody tweet it to him.,desire,neutral
I watched the making of and was very surprised how much Halle Berry trained for this role. For Keanu it was kinda known, but she was awesome, too.,surprise,positive
I always thought that the assassins who appeared in front of John Wick did it to show respect. Imagine you get to meet the best in your line of work.. in this case killing, but  it's more than work to them, it's their way of living so John Wick is kind of a living legend, they don't think dying in his hands is a bad thing, that's what i like to think anyways,approval,negative
Trivia: Keanu was so good with his gun techniques that he was moving too quickly. The director told him to slow down. Source: TFBTV,neutral,negative
I've got to tell you, I have been watching these videos from a long time now and the headshot sequence was one of the finest moments in this channel,admiration,positive
‚ÄúThe under water headshot‚Äù cracked me up,amusement,negative
1:25 that press check... a work of glory. And apparently model-specific. It's a model of gun famous for jamming, so he checked it didn't jam.

Pachino also does a press-check in Heat, in the lift with shotgun Indian, but his press-check is a cutway to a double, it's not Al.,neutral,neutral
in the first movie, The Continental is definitely a regular hotel, that is also secretly an underworld assassin hotel... for example, to get to the club, he has to first walk through the laundry room and give a password or something... and it definitely doesn‚Äôt have a rooftop garden and several floors made entirely out of glass.,neutral,neutral
The menagerie of "headshots" had me laughing for a good 10 minutes!! Awesome job!,amusement,positive
‚ÄúJohn Wick Chapter 3 Lorem Ipsum‚Äù was understated genius,admiration,positive
Pretty much all of the kills in John Wick 3 can be justified for pretty much one reason- everybody is trying to kill him for the ridiculous bounty on his head.,neutral,negative
Say what you will about sequel baiting, the "Well, are ya, John? ‚Ä¶.. Yeah." at the end of Parabellum was masterful, and sends chills down my spine every time I watch it.,admiration,positive

This was the best yet! ü§£ The headshot montage was just frickin hilarious,amusement,positive
incredible trailer!!! lmbo!!! mad and total respect for 2:10 and 4:55!!! I think Keanu's brain frequency is significantly higher than the average man's and that's why we don't get him yet we still love him and we know he's wise!!!,admiration,positive
You got Keanu Reeves who keeps shooting and Tom Cruise who keeps running...eventually these two got to meet up at some point.,neutral,neutral
We admire how the third movie shows the unconventional way of slaying someone at the library with school-related materials when fookin pencil isn't around. One good informative entry for Wickipedia.,admiration,positive
I'm disappointed you didnt call him the Pencil Punisher during the naming section,disappointment,negative
OKAY üòÇ the headshot list was FREAKIN brilliant...but the "underwater headshot" killed me üòÇüòÇüòÇ,admiration,positive
I love them more and more with every sequel.,love,positive
You got to admit John wick has the most incredible fight scenes like of any movie they are so brutal and realistic and for all you gun lovers out there they actually cohere to have guns work with having to reload and running out of ammunition without firing a hundred rounds,admiration,positive
This guy naming the headshots is the best thing I have heard all year. Change my mind.,admiration,positive
This one was genuinely funny. Soo many great 1 liners.,amusement,positive
I have never seen this series of movies, but I bet this trailer is far better.  Loved the different types of headshots!,love,positive

rules of the world...never get into a fight with an actor that trains like Tom or Keanu.,love,positive
He wasn‚Äôt killing people in John Wick 3 for ‚ÄúVague reasons‚Äù. He was very clearly on the run because of the bounty that he had on his head from killing on continental grounds at the end of chapter 2.,neutral,negative
OK, 99% of the alternative characters names you come up with I don't get the joke or the reference, but this "Poorpheus" was top notch.
PS: Also the "Lorem Ipsum".,approval,positive

The edits and clip transition on this video were awesome,admiration,positive
that fighst sequence with Halle Berry and the dogs was probably the coolest in the whole trilogy,admiration,positive
Damn. This makes me want to watch those movies again. Thanks, SJ.,gratitude,positive
HAHAHA Oh gosh, the Meet Joe Black clip.. SO GOOD! I've watched that so many times on repeat. I love the Headshot montage at the end! :),admiration,positive
OMG.  You made me laugh so hard I got a cramp.  It still hurts.  But damn, that was FUNNY!,amusement,positive
Everyone talks about amazing action. But the cinematography is top notch too, especially in 3. Action movies rarely look this good visually.,admiration,positive
I'm in for Tom Cruise playing the Big Bad in John Wick 4. Or an Ally. He'd turn the whole filming into a contest of who can train harder and personally do crazier stunts. And would probably win both.

This is actually an awesome idea.,admiration,positive

This just made me appreciate John Wick even more... 

Y'all do realize that Tom Cruise has played a vampire and Keanu has been spotted in photos from the 1800s? This is clearly an example of Van Helsing or perhaps Highlander... at some point, either Tom or Keanu is going to win their centuries long game of cat and mouse and there will be only 1...,realization,positive

They need to do a Mission Impossible/ John Wick crossover. Where Tom has to infiltrate a "Secret Underground Organization" that wants to take over the world.

Keanu is pretty clear that he doesn't do his own stunts. He does the fighting, but when it comes to things like getting hit by a car, he has stunt men whom he often praises.,neutral,neutral
"John Wick: Lorem Ipsum" is just the perfectly semiotical statement about a franchise like this.,neutral,positive
Funny thing about the cars - he got hit by one in the first film and it knocked him unconscious. Maybe that just enabled him to build up a resistance to high-velocity vehicle impact.,amusement,negative
"Allez Cuisine!" killed me.  I'm dead now.  Iron Chef Head Shot.,sadness,negative

It makes sense that‚Äôs he‚Äôs gotten better at fighting in each one. First movie is him fresh coming back out of retirement for years. Subsequent two are him having dusted off the kinks gradually lol,amusement,positive
The car thing is actually a strategic choice! When you know you're about to get hit by a car, but you don't have time to get out of the way, your best chance of survival is to jump onto the hood! In the Brad Pitt clip, he doesn't move, and his legs are clearly broken horribly. But, John (who was very well trained) knew this, and turned to the side and did a little jump on to the hoods of the cars to avoid injury.,neutral,negative

When "Meet Joe Black" was in theaters, my friends would let me sneak into several showings for that Brad Pitt death scene, and there was ALWAYS that ONE person that would bust out laughing like I did. Good times.,joy,positive
@2:44  while I *DID* appreciate the attention to detail of the missing finger üò≥for the rest of the movie: I find it hard to believe that John Wick has lived the life he's lived (EVEN just the parts we've seen onscreen) and still had all ten fingers up to that point.,admiration,positive
John Wick's one weakness is cars. I love how each sequel he gets hit by more cars.,love,negative

John Wick is invincible and therefore cannot even be harmed by Honest Trailers: the movies are too aware of their own ridiculousness for a parody of the plots to be funny (so, yes, I suspect that 1/3 of NYC being involved in an assassins' guild that is also the world's most efficient government is meant to be silly), the fact that they'll make them until we're bored is pretty obvious (and it's pretty incredible that a concept this thin has somehow been fun for three movies), the throwback Matrix references are unapologetic fan service, and, well, the headshots are kinda what we came for?
