Fair play to the editors of Honest Trailers. Especially ones where they do a gag like the head shot one. That’s a lot of work.,admiration,positive
Imagine if John Wick just left the gas station a little earlier.,neutral,neutral
They forgot the 'Pencil Us In', the 'Stabbing Headache', the 'Eye Must Scream' and the 'Quick Reload/Double Kill' Headshots. Also throwing things at people (Helmets, Guns, Unbalanced Knives).,neutral,negative
"john wick is immune to cars running him over" killed me,sadness,negative
You'd think at one point in the sequels, one assassin would put their gun down and just walk away.,neutral,negative
"My money's on Tom.. little guy freaks me out..." I died at that line, it made me laugh so hard,amusement,positive
I loved the cameo from the The Raid martial artists and the fact he didn’t kill them. It was a nice little Easter egg that seemed like a mark of respect.,love,positive
Those John Wick movies and the Atomic Blonde movie are just epic because  there are so very few cuts in the action scenes.  Also love Scott Adkins output. That man is such an underrated action star.,admiration,positive
6:03 the way he made his voice sound like he was underwater for the “Underwater headshot” was so cool,admiration,positive
Loved how you named all the headshots! Loved the underwater one the most! Honestly, you guys rock!,love,positive

Ok the underwater voice really had me, it came out of nowhere.,neutral,positive
Lionsgate is filming 4 and 5 while writing and planning a 6th and 7th. Good thing Keanu is immortal.,admiration,positive
it may go on and make the story more ridiculous, but those well choreographed fight scenes without too much cuts and without shaky cam will always be intense and entertaining to me,amusement,positive
The 'Who needs a gun headshot' was a perfect finisher. 

The muffled voice underwater headshot was epic. 

Well done.
 Lol,admiration,positive
I love how this video pointed out so many flaws of these moves but still managed to make these movies look awesome af,love,positive
I just adore how Screen Junkies and our dear Epic Voice Guy can make a movie sound so terrible and yet so awesome at the same time.,admiration,positive
Exactly. Everyone in the world is part of the underworld because it's Keanu's own Matrix that they made specially for him,approval,neutral
I thought the headshot names won't end 🤣🤣🤣
And "the John Wickipedia" killed me 🤣,disappointment,negative
The novelty of the action style is what makes John Wick unique,neutral,positive
This trailer makes me realize that John Wick 3 was so crazy that I don’t even remember much of John Wick 2.,realization,negative
You guys are awesome this was hands down the best honest trailer ever!!!!!! Those headshot names had me literally rolling. Please never stop!!!!!,admiration,positive
The instance where he says “giving him immunity being run over by cars” and John wick getting hit by 2 cars at the same moment was hilarious😂,amusement,negative
I wish Keanu would upload his reaction to this Honest Trailer. Somebody tweet it to him.,desire,neutral
I watched the making of and was very surprised how much Halle Berry trained for this role. For Keanu it was kinda known, but she was awesome, too.,surprise,positive
I always thought that the assassins who appeared in front of John Wick did it to show respect. Imagine you get to meet the best in your line of work.. in this case killing, but  it's more than work to them, it's their way of living so John Wick is kind of a living legend, they don't think dying in his hands is a bad thing, that's what i like to think anyways,approval,negative
Trivia: Keanu was so good with his gun techniques that he was moving too quickly. The director told him to slow down. Source: TFBTV,neutral,negative
I've got to tell you, I have been watching these videos from a long time now and the headshot sequence was one of the finest moments in this channel,admiration,positive
“The under water headshot” cracked me up,amusement,negative
1:25 that press check... a work of glory. And apparently model-specific. It's a model of gun famous for jamming, so he checked it didn't jam.

Pachino also does a press-check in Heat, in the lift with shotgun Indian, but his press-check is a cutway to a double, it's not Al.,neutral,neutral
in the first movie, The Continental is definitely a regular hotel, that is also secretly an underworld assassin hotel... for example, to get to the club, he has to first walk through the laundry room and give a password or something... and it definitely doesn’t have a rooftop garden and several floors made entirely out of glass.,neutral,neutral
The menagerie of "headshots" had me laughing for a good 10 minutes!! Awesome job!,amusement,positive
“John Wick Chapter 3 Lorem Ipsum” was understated genius,admiration,positive
Pretty much all of the kills in John Wick 3 can be justified for pretty much one reason- everybody is trying to kill him for the ridiculous bounty on his head.,neutral,negative
Say what you will about sequel baiting, the "Well, are ya, John? ….. Yeah." at the end of Parabellum was masterful, and sends chills down my spine every time I watch it.,admiration,positive
That Halle berry cat woman nickname reference was pure genius,admiration,positive
"Don't bother watching the rest of Meet Joe Black, this is the only good part."

And I took that personally.,neutral,positive
Right now tryna avoid incredible pain. This made me lmao. Thanks guys.,gratitude,positive
This was the best yet! 🤣 The headshot montage was just frickin hilarious,amusement,positive
incredible trailer!!! lmbo!!! mad and total respect for 2:10 and 4:55!!! I think Keanu's brain frequency is significantly higher than the average man's and that's why we don't get him yet we still love him and we know he's wise!!!,admiration,positive
You got Keanu Reeves who keeps shooting and Tom Cruise who keeps running...eventually these two got to meet up at some point.,neutral,neutral
We admire how the third movie shows the unconventional way of slaying someone at the library with school-related materials when fookin pencil isn't around. One good informative entry for Wickipedia.,admiration,positive
I'm disappointed you didnt call him the Pencil Punisher during the naming section,disappointment,negative
OKAY 😂 the headshot list was FREAKIN brilliant...but the "underwater headshot" killed me 😂😂😂,admiration,positive
I love them more and more with every sequel.,love,positive
You got to admit John wick has the most incredible fight scenes like of any movie they are so brutal and realistic and for all you gun lovers out there they actually cohere to have guns work with having to reload and running out of ammunition without firing a hundred rounds,admiration,positive
This guy naming the headshots is the best thing I have heard all year. Change my mind.,admiration,positive
This one was genuinely funny. Soo many great 1 liners.,amusement,positive
I have never seen this series of movies, but I bet this trailer is far better.  Loved the different types of headshots!,love,positive
That song choice during the headshots bit was pure comedy gold.,amusement,positive
"Who even needs a gun ?" Headshot ,was the  best,admiration,positive
I lost my breath for laughing so hard at the Meet Joe Black joke! 😅😂😂🤣,amusement,positive
This is by far the funniest Honest Trailers has been in a while.,amusement,positive
This is probably the most I have ever laughed at an Honest Trailer!,amusement,positive
The headshot naming was so funny that I'll even forgive the gross error of calling the reason behind Parabellum 'vague'. It was about basic survival.,amusement,negative
Here just to say the headshot collage is just genius.,admiration,positive
Epic writing, Screen Junkies. 🤣 Hats off! 🙏🏻,admiration,positive
The headshot bit and the end was amazing 😂,admiration,positive

loves animals, loves guns, love powerful perfectly timed music and...Keanu. its so perfect, how can you not love this. 
rules of the world...never get into a fight with an actor that trains like Tom or Keanu.,love,positive
He wasn’t killing people in John Wick 3 for “Vague reasons”. He was very clearly on the run because of the bounty that he had on his head from killing on continental grounds at the end of chapter 2.,neutral,negative
OK, 99% of the alternative characters names you come up with I don't get the joke or the reference, but this "Poorpheus" was top notch.
PS: Also the "Lorem Ipsum".,approval,positive
I think we're all waiting for a movie with a fight between Keanu and Tom. That would be epic.,excitement,positive
The edits and clip transition on this video were awesome,admiration,positive
that fighst sequence with Halle Berry and the dogs was probably the coolest in the whole trilogy,admiration,positive
Damn. This makes me want to watch those movies again. Thanks, SJ.,gratitude,positive
HAHAHA Oh gosh, the Meet Joe Black clip.. SO GOOD! I've watched that so many times on repeat. I love the Headshot montage at the end! :),admiration,positive
OMG.  You made me laugh so hard I got a cramp.  It still hurts.  But damn, that was FUNNY!,amusement,positive
Everyone talks about amazing action. But the cinematography is top notch too, especially in 3. Action movies rarely look this good visually.,admiration,positive
I'm in for Tom Cruise playing the Big Bad in John Wick 4. Or an Ally. He'd turn the whole filming into a contest of who can train harder and personally do crazier stunts. And would probably win both.

This is actually an awesome idea.,admiration,positive
Came for some solid one liners, stayed for the head-shot montage,neutral,neutral
I laughed harder at this honest trailer than I have at any other.,amusement,positive

Thanks, Epic Voice Guy! What a great idea to put Tom Cruise vs. Keanu Reeves. I would like to see that happen in some way.,gratitude,positive
This Honest Trailer is breathtaking,admiration,positive
This just made me appreciate John Wick even more... 

Y'all do realize that Tom Cruise has played a vampire and Keanu has been spotted in photos from the 1800s? This is clearly an example of Van Helsing or perhaps Highlander... at some point, either Tom or Keanu is going to win their centuries long game of cat and mouse and there will be only 1...,realization,positive

They need to do a Mission Impossible/ John Wick crossover. Where Tom has to infiltrate a "Secret Underground Organization" that wants to take over the world. John Wick finds out the that US Government has sent some operatives to kill the High table, but is actually setting them up for failure, but Tom holds a marker for John.,neutral,negative
This trailer is so much better than both movies it refers to, i was close to rewatch them OMG,admiration,positive

Love the Stylish & Classy take on the back stories & the well reEdited trailers! Top Job! Thanks! ... JW🕯🌷🌿,gratitude,positive
Keanu is pretty clear that he doesn't do his own stunts. He does the fighting, but when it comes to things like getting hit by a car, he has stunt men whom he often praises.,neutral,neutral
"John Wick: Lorem Ipsum" is just the perfectly semiotical statement about a franchise like this.,neutral,positive
Funny thing about the cars - he got hit by one in the first film and it knocked him unconscious. Maybe that just enabled him to build up a resistance to high-velocity vehicle impact.,amusement,negative
"Allez Cuisine!" killed me.  I'm dead now.  Iron Chef Head Shot.,sadness,negative
Some movies hire extras, John Wick franchise hires head-shots.,neutral,neutral
I love these films and this is amazing! Also is there a mission impossible honest trailer? Like a whole franchise one or any individual ones?,admiration,positive

Man,  those John Wick films did  have a lot of headshots. Good job Honest Trailers putting together all the Headshots together. That's a LOT of headshots! 5:25-6:53.,admiration,positive
I absolutely lost it with the headshots compilation! Bravo!,admiration,positive
That headshot ending compilation was funny AF!!!! 😂,amusement,positive
1. The headshot dictionary: PERFECTION! 2. Your videos reach a sky-high level when you allow for some time to pass after the movie is released. 3. Please do an Honest TV Trailer for THE STRAIN! Thank you!,gratitude,positive

You finally had me at the underwater headshot 😂😅😅😂😂,approval,positive
appreciate the "underwater" muffle headshot!,admiration,positive
that laxative for criminals line had me rolling cus it so true lol,amusement,positive
It makes sense that’s he’s gotten better at fighting in each one. First movie is him fresh coming back out of retirement for years. Subsequent two are him having dusted off the kinks gradually lol,amusement,positive
The car thing is actually a strategic choice! When you know you're about to get hit by a car, but you don't have time to get out of the way, your best chance of survival is to jump onto the hood! In the Brad Pitt clip, he doesn't move, and his legs are clearly broken horribly. But, John (who was very well trained) knew this, and turned to the side and did a little jump on to the hoods of the cars to avoid injury.,neutral,negative
We need a movie with Tom Cruise and Keanu Reeves together 🙂 that would be the one to watch,desire,positive
The throat slash plus headshot combo platter 😂😂😂😂,amusement,neutral
"In John Wick 3, he'll kill so many people for such vague reasons..."

My only complain with this (for now) trilogy is why did John cut his finger for The Boss or whatever if he was just going to betray him so fast,neutral,negative
The underwater headshot voice made me chuckle😂,amusement,positive
The horse kicking scene was just too much. 😂,amusement,positive
Honestly the best honest trailer EVER,admiration,positive
I was in the theater and laughed so hard when brad pit got hit by those cars that the lady next to me got mad at me.,amusement,negative
When "Meet Joe Black" was in theaters, my friends would let me sneak into several showings for that Brad Pitt death scene, and there was ALWAYS that ONE person that would bust out laughing like I did. Good times.,joy,positive
@2:44  while I *DID* appreciate the attention to detail of the missing finger 😳for the rest of the movie: I find it hard to believe that John Wick has lived the life he's lived (EVEN just the parts we've seen onscreen) and still had all ten fingers up to that point.,admiration,positive
John Wick's one weakness is cars. I love how each sequel he gets hit by more cars.,love,negative
Keanu reeves is the Wickerman. Way funnier than it should be,amusement,positive

I thought the Underwater Headshot was funny enough, but the John Wickipedia beat it for a long shot 🤣,amusement,negative
The moment when John wick says yeah in the end of chapter 3 he looked and sounded so terrifying that it was more scarer than most horror movies,fear,negative

The scary part is I actually think he can shoot like that for real..,fear,negative
tbf about the car thing. Even getting hit by a slower car can be damaging. It's why stuntmen tend to want to take the impact in a certain way. So it wouldn't be surprising if trained assassins took the same trick so they could minimize their injuries too.,neutral,negative
Strange: Is that all the headshots?
Wick: You wanted more?!,curiosity,neutral

John Wick 1 was good. Even with the silliness, it somehow made sense. There was just enough complexity for you to be curious about the assassin universe.

But in 2 and 3, it just gets blown outta proportions to the point that now it just looks stupid.

I hope 'Nobody' doesn't do the same crap but these greedy Hollywood execs most probably will. They just don't know when to end a good thing.,curiosity,negative

John Wick is invincible and therefore cannot even be harmed by Honest Trailers: the movies are too aware of their own ridiculousness for a parody of the plots to be funny (so, yes, I suspect that 1/3 of NYC being involved in an assassins' guild that is also the world's most efficient government is meant to be silly), the fact that they'll make them until we're bored is pretty obvious (and it's pretty incredible that a concept this thin has somehow been fun for three movies), the throwback Matrix references are unapologetic fan service, and, well, the headshots are kinda what we came for?
